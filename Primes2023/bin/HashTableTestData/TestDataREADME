All test data is in the folder HashTableTestData, full of plaintext files.

HashTable.java is the main class I wrote, and solves the Main Problem 
of creating a hash table with custom hash & probe functions.

Test data for HashTable.java is created by edited output from the helper programs 
HashTableRandomInputDistributionGenerator.java and HashTableRandomInputNumberGenerator.java.

For the files pack of:
testDataNL
testDataNdistributions
testDataNnumbersM
testDataNall

where N and M are replaced by positive integers, here are their following details:

testDataNL contains L for case N
testDataNdistributions contains the L distributions for case N
testDataNnumbersM contains the Mth example of 950 numbers generated by 
the distribution of testDataNdistributions. THIS FILE is the file that would be moved to the default location 
and then read for input for the HashTable.java program.
testDataNall contains all of L, the L distributions, and the example number generations. 
It also has some details on intentions behin what is being tested:
for ex, one test case is testing reading whitespace, another if program will crash given X error, etc.

(Note 950/1021 is about 0.93, which is <0.95 but >0.75, so it is a suitable load factor 
for the hash table I have created to have capacity 1021.)
